# Whitebox
Machine learning tools and frameworks that are mostly built on sklearn and other open source machine learning frameworks.


## Guiding principles

- __User friendliness.__ Whitebox is an API designed for human beings. Whitebox follows best practices for reducing cognitive load and eliminates the need for boiler-plate code: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error.

- __Modularity.__ Whitebox aims to provide cogs that implement a consistent API which can be arbitrarily pieces together in order to provide ultimate flexibility.

- __Work with Python__. No separate models configuration files in a declarative format. Models are described in Python code, which is compact, easier to debug, and allows for ease of extensibility.

- __Built on the shoulders of giants__. Whitebox does not reinvent the wheel but rather uses the wide selection of tools available for data scientists and machine learning experts.
